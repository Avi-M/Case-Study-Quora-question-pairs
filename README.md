## Case-Study-Quora-question-pairs
Quora is a social media platform where people ask questions and can connect to the actual experts who contribute unique insights and quality answers. Quora has an enormous user base and over 100 million people visit Quora every month,
so it’s no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause readers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, 
and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. so the PROBLEM is:¶ 
1.Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. 
2.This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. 
3.We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
